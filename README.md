# hhnk-modelbuilder

Temporary repository for the further development of the modelbuilder (and
datachecker as a preprocessing step). Will be transferred to a permanent
repository when the cookie-cutter is able to create Docker projects

## Usage

Pull the latest code from this repository using git/GitHub desktop.

On command line (cmd on Windows) browse to the repository location

`docker-compose build` builds the image as defined by the `Dockerfile`

`docker-compose up -d` starts the containers in daemon mode. Webinterface is now available through http://localhost:5000. The polder id field for the model builder corresponds with the polder_id field in the poldercluster layer in the HDB. The polder name is used for filenames.

Make sure you have your input data ready within the `data` folder (see section below) before running the datachecker or modelbuilder.

## Command line usage

`docker-compose run hhnk bash` runs the hhnk image in the container and brings you to the command line from which you can start the datachecker or the modelbuilder. You can replace `bash` with any command to execute that command directly.

To run the datachecker either run `python3 /code/datachecker/datachecker.py` from within the container, or run the image directly with the datachecker command: `docker-compose run hhnk python3 /code/datachecker/datachecker.py`

The modelbuilder has to be initialized with 2 variables, the `polder_id` and the `polder_name`. The `polder_id` is used to select data from the datachecker within the polder which id you supply, the `polder_name` is used in the output filenames (`.sqlite`, `.tif`). To run the modelbuilder use for example `python3 /code/modelbuilder/modelbuilder.py 15 starnmeer` from within the container or start the container like this `docker-compose run hhnk python3 /code/modelbuilder/modelbuilder.py 15 starnmeer`

To stop the container run `docker-compose stop`.

Periodically, run `docker system prune` to clean up old stuff.

## Data
If you don't specify any location for the input, output and fixed data it will bind the `data` directory within your github folder on your PC.
Make sure that the folder exists with at least the following data:

```bash
data
├───fixed_data
│   ├───datamining_ahn3
│   ├───DEM
│   │   └───dem_floor_5cm
│   ├───hydroobjectid
│   └───other
└───input
    ├───DAMO.gdb
    └───HDB.gdb
```

## Development

`docker-compose pull` to grab the images.

`docker-compose build` to build the image as defined by the `Dockerfile`.

`docker-compose up -d` to start everything in "daemon" mode. The "hhnk" docker
will exit as it isn't a service that stays up, which is fine.

`docker-compose run hhnk SOMETHING` runs "SOMETHING" on the commandline of the
hhnk docker. "bash", "python", etc.

For instance: `docker-compose run hhnk psql -h db -U postgres`
Or: `docker-compose run hhnk psql -h db -U postgres -f sql/example.sql`


Afterwards, `docker-compose stop` to stop everything.

Periodically, run `docker system prune` to clean up old stuff.


## Using production settings

First things first: create an access token at
https://github.com/settings/tokens, give it just "read:packages"
permission. Remember the token somewhere.

`docker login docker.pkg.github.com -u your-github-username` and give it the
token as a password.

Then you can use the same docker-compose commands as mentioned above, but with
an extra `-f docker-compose.deploy.yml`. Note: you don't need to build as
you'll grab the github-actions-build image instead:

	docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml pull
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up -d
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml run hhnk bash
	docker-compose -f docker-compose.deploy.yml stop

## Python packages
In the `requirements.txt` file the python packages (including version number) that are installed at build are noted. Amongst others there is the `threedi-modelchecker`. The modelchecker checks the output `.sqlite` one last time on errors. The version of the modelchecker expects a specific 3Di database structure. When updating the `threedi-modelchecker` you might also have to update the 3Di database template, and possibly edit some of the scripts filling the 3Di database and vica versa.

## Known issues
Pulling from GitHub on Windows sometimes the line endings of the .sh files, causing the datachecker/modelbuilder to crash. Line-endings of .sh files should always be Unix (LF). Using Notepad++ this can be changed (right-bottom toolbar). This should be fixed now with the use of .gitattribute. When creating a new .sh file, make sure to select the Unix (LF) line ending.
